# Vegetarian

A vegetarian diet excludes meat and fish but allows dairy products and eggs. This diet is often chosen for ethical, environmental, or health reasons. It includes a variety of plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, along with dairy and eggs for protein and other nutrients.
