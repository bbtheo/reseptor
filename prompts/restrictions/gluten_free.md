# Gluten-Free

A gluten-free diet excludes wheat, barley, rye, and any ingredients derived from these grains. This diet is essential for individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergies. It focuses on naturally gluten-free foods such as fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, dairy, and grains like rice, quinoa, and corn.
