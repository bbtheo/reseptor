# Vegan

A vegan diet excludes all animal products, including meat, fish, dairy, eggs, and honey. This diet is often adopted for ethical reasons, environmental concerns, or health benefits. It focuses on plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and avoids any products derived from animals.
